An exploratory learning project that uses JavaScript30 projects as a way to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# a learning process
From a language-learning perspective, a language is best learned from hands-on practice and scaffolded learning. Once the scaffolding is removed, then the students
have the agency to complete the scaffolding and fill in the gaps. This repository uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build foundational projects that start small with
minimal frameworks.

JavaScript is an expressive languages. These projects are not the most responsive, but they provide the scaffolding to use other frameworks like Svelte, Vue, or React
to become responsive. I've chosen JavaScript as a first language because it helps me chip away at the paint as to apply a freshcoat of paint in a more dynamic and 
expressive way. JavaScript stands out to me as mentioned in [`JavaScript is a Dysfunctional Programming Language`](https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/javascript-is-a-dysfunctional-programming-language-a1f4866e186f)
where the author states that JavaScript is not a functional programming language and that the language is not a proper engineering language. I believe the author underestimates JavaScript potential for its current usage in web applications where JavaScript builds a modest frontend (<20K LOC) and microservices and serverless rendering pick up the rest.
That brings me to mention other frameworks such as Svelte. Eventually I would like to translate most of these smaller projects into TypeScript and incorporate them into a
interface that adds Svelte's responsiveness.

TypeScript and Svelte compensate for some shortcomings of JavaScript.

JavaScript's ecosystem for one interest me because of the strong ecosystem and community base. JavaScript - as a powerful object literal notation where objects can be created only
by listing their components - stands out to me in the way it represents data and inspired JSON data files.
